            Hey! I am Yagnesh Modh, a designer turned No-Code entrepreneur and I
            help businesses save precious time and money by building software
            without code.
            <p className="py-6  ">
              I started India's first No-Code studio(EPYC) along with my bud
              Mayank ðŸ‘‰We've built products for startups without code that
              scaled to become unicorns later.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the past couple of years, I've trained and mentored 6000+
              students in No-Code, and helped them build their dream products,
              without ever learning to code. EVER!
